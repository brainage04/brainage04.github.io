    description: This was the first long-form entertainment video I edited for my main YouTube channel, and it amassed about 4,500 views and a 100% (!!!) like to dislike ratio. I put a lot of effort into editing this video, and while I was disappointed it didn't do as well as I thought it would, given I had only uploaded short-form videos to this channel beforehand, it did pretty well.
