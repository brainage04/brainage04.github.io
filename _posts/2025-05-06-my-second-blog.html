<p>A lot has happened since my last blog (which was over 6 months ago now):</p>
<ol>
    <li>Started freelance Minecraft mod development (2 projects, first one confidential, second one almost done)</li>
    <li>Continued work on my Minecraft mods (existing ones such as BrainageHUD and new ones too)</li>
    <li>Finally (FINALLY) ported my rendering code from BrainageHUD into a library for use in other mods (HudRendererLib)</li>
</ol>

<p>
    University is quite boring but I'm doing well - I got a perfect score on my first
    assignment in my DSA unit!!! (30/30, 15 from the autograder and 15 from the report).
    I'm pretty sure I haven't gotten a perfect score on any assignments since my first semester.
    Was a welcome surprise.
</p>

<p>I have another list of things I want to do:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Continue work on BrainageHUD and HudRendererLib (config and rendering code stores/does things in weird ways)</li>
    <li>Learn about Android emulation (mostly cause I wanna use AstroDX on my PC lol)</li>
    <li>Continue working on a basic MaiMai chart viewer/editor (with C# and Avalonia - not yet sure if this is a good choice of tooling lol)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are my previous blog's non-work related goals for references:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maimai: first 14 S rank (current best is ~96.5%, ~0.5% away)</li>
    <li>SDVX: first 17 pass</li>
    <li>DDR: first 17 AAA, first 18 AA+ (950k+)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's some updates for those:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maimai: countless 14 and 14+ S ranks (best 14 is ~100.2%, best 14+ is ~99.25%)</li>
    <li>SDVX: countless 17 passes (first 17 S!!!, at home), a 16 PUC!!! (at home), and several 18 AA+'s</li>
    <li>DDR: 3 17 AAA's, countless 18 AA+'s' (2 over 970k!!!), and 2 16 PFC's!!!</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I also started taking Taiko more seriously, and have passed 2 Extreme 10* maps!!!
    I have also gotten 987k with 17 OK's on Supernova [Hard] 8*,
    which is one of my best accuracy scores
    (outside of my DFC on Rabbit Hole lol).
</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read my second blog!</p>
