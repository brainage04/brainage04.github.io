<p>
    I'll use this to talk about anything software related
    that's too long for Twitter to handle.
</p>
<p>
    I'm almost done with university for the year now -
    I have 1 assignment due this week, 2 due next week,
    and 1 exam the week after that. Then I'm all done!
</p>

<p>
    Once I'm finished with university form the year,
    I have a list of things I want to do:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Continue work on personal projects (BrainageHUD, SkyBrain/SkyBrainDB, post on SkyBrain/SkyBrainDB coming soon?)</li>
    <li>Work more hours at my current part time job to save more money (~25 hours/week)</li>
    <li>Upskill for CS jobs (DSA, Java 7/8, Spring)</li>
    <li>Apply for part-time work in the CS industry (junior dev positions working with Java 8/17/21 is my best bet)</li>
</ol>

<p>I also have a few extra, non-work related goals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maimai: first 14 S rank (current best is ~96.5%, ~0.5% away)</li>
    <li>SDVX: first 17 pass</li>
    <li>DDR: first 17 AAA, first 18 AA+ (950k+)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read my first blog!</p>
