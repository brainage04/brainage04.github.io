<p>A lot has happened since my last blog (which was about 8 months ago now):</p>
<ol>
    <li>I graduated from university with a Bachelor in Information Technology (Computer Science) - with Distinction!!!
    </li>
    <li>Made a bunch more Minecraft mods</li>
    <li>Got a lot better at MaiMai</li>
</ol>

<p>
    On one hand, I'm glad that university is over, but I'm also not really enjoying the job search.
    Feels like there's not that much out there for me. I know it will get better around late Jan/early Feb
    but I wouldn't be surprised if I don't find a job for 6-12 months. I don't know what to do.
</p>

<p>I have another list of things I want to do, but this one is REALLY long - I have quite a backlog. As you can see most
    of them are to do with Minecraft mods:</p>
<ol>
    <li>work on Job Scraper</li>
    <li>finish BrainageMinigames</li>
    <li>merge BrainageUHC with BrainageMinigames</li>
    <li>finish BrainageServerUtils (according to todo in README)</li>
    <li>finish IceSkates (fix item models for skates not working)</li>
    <li>finish ProceduralDungeon</li>
    <li>finish FortniteInMinecraft</li>
    <li>continue working on NPCAddons</li>
    <li>refactor forge template to match fabric template? and rename to ForgeClientTemplate</li>
    <li>create ForgeServerTemplate? (this is for if I ever want to make a 1.8.9 server with minigames or something like
        that)</li>
    <li>figure out what to do with ToggleSprint (probably try to make same as BrainageHUD)</li>
    <li>update SimpleTelekinesis
        <ul>
            <li>rewrite code that teleports item drops to work with blocks that have more than 1 unique drop/do not
                always drop something</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hypixel /play autocomplete mod - https://api.hypixel.net/v2/resources/games
        <ul>
            <li>Use the keys in the modeNames objects in propertyN objects in the games object</li>
            <li>There's no autocomplete for any versions in vanilla (not even latest)</li>
            <li>Check out Hypixel Mod API for this?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>try making my own config library for Fabric 1.21.11</li>
    <li>try making my own config library for Forge 1.8.9</li>
    <li>start working on TextureAtlasGenerator again - been smashing my head against a wall for 20+ hours. idk what to
        do. try getting llm to help maybe? study RenderPipelines or other mods that use them?</li>
    <li>get back to work on SkyBrain/SkyBrainDB - would prefer to finish TextureAtlasGenerator first so I have a more
        comprehensive list of items now that the foraging update has been released</li>
    <li>Overworld Nether Structures (Bastion especially would be good)
        <ul>
            <li>Blackstone -> Cobblestone</li>
            <li>Lava -> Water</li>
            <li>Gold -> Diamond</li>
            <li>Nether Brick -> Stone Brick</li>
            <li>Wither Skeletons -> OP Skeletons (OP = prot 2-4 diamond/netherite armour, power 3-5 bow, sharpness 3-5
                sword/axe)</li>
            <li>Piglins -> OP Zombies</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Advanced Path Finder
        <ul>
            <li>can path find under a wide range of circumstances including:
                <ul>
                    <li>ability to sprint, sneak and jump</li>
                    <li>potion effects/player attributes (specifically speed/walk speed and jump boost/jump strength)
                    </li>
                    <li>damage effects (such as poison or fire, which would cause knockback and affect pathing that
                        requires jumping)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>don't forget to include diagonals</li>
            <li>don't forget to remove path finding nodes that are in a straight line as they are redundant</li>
            <li>command to determine path and command to actually path find</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Other minor things on my todo list:
        <ul>
            <li>modify TpRequest class in SimpleTPA to implement Comparable&lt;TpRequest&gt; with only the to/from
                fields and see if it works with a HashSet</li>
            <li>continue studying modrinth integration and test with MagicCarpet</li>
            <li>look into Architectury Plugin (Gradle plugin that facilitates multiplatform mod development)
                <ul>
                    <li>https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api</li>

                    <li>https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16210-architectury</li>
                    <li>might be too much effort though tbh</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Thanks for taking the time to read my third blog!
    I'll be making a lot more of these now, as I'd like to document my experiences when making projects on here
    (for present projects and future once as well as previous ones).
