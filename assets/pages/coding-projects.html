<p>
    I actually have so many Java projects (2 modding templates, 1 library, over a dozen mods)
    that I've actually had to go out of my way to separate my Java projects from all my other projects
    because otherwise the page is comically long.
</p>

<p>
    For my Java projects, please see <a href="/coding-projects/java/">Java Projects</a>.
    I've also added my Minecraft datapack template there as well,
    as it seems most appropriate given the vast majority of projects here are Minecraft related.
</p>

<p>
    Notable projects here include:
    <ul>
        <li>Two Minecraft mod commissions (one private, one private for now) - first time I got paid to create software!</li>
        <li>My modding templates for Fabric (client and server)</li>
        <li>Various content mods (MagicCarpet, IceSkates, ProceduralDungeon)</li>
        <li>Various utility mods (BrainageHUD, SimpleTPA/VeinMiner/Telekinesis, GetEnchantInfo)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    For my other projects (C#, Python, web), please see <a href="/coding-projects/other/">Other Projects</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Notable projects here include:
    <ul>
        <li>A Unity/C# MaiMai emulator - WIP</li>
        <li>A standalone C#/WinForms image browser (Windows 10 Photos with less slop)</li>
        <li>My MXB362 Advanced Visualisation and Data Science case study (Intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) Over Time)</li>
    </ul>
