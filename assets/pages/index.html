  Hello! My name is Thomas, and this is my website that I designed from scratch
  in HTML/CSS (+ a tiny bit of JS) and Jekyll for templating (so I don't
  have to copy/paste my nav and footer 6 billion times). Here you can find
  my social media links, projects I'm working on and my rhythm game stats.
</p>
<p>
  I'm a 3rd year university student currently looking for part-time work
  in the IT industry (will be ready to transition to full-time after my
  graduation in late 2025).
</p>
<p>
  I specialise in web design (HTML, CSS, SvelteKit), web development
  (JS, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js) and Minecraft modding (Java -
  Forge 1.8.9 and Fabric 1.19.x/1.20.x/1.21.x)
</p>
