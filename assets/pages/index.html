    Hello! My name is Thomas, and this is my website that I designed from
    scratch in HTML/CSS (+ a tiny bit of JS) and Jekyll for templating (so I
    don't have to copy/paste my nav and footer 6 billion times). Here you can
    find my social media links, my skills, coding projects I'm working on and my
    rhythm game stats.
</p>
<p>
    I'm a 3rd year university student currently looking for part-time work in
    the IT industry (will be ready to transition to full-time after my
    graduation in late 2025).
</p>
<p>
    I specialise in web design, web development and Minecraft modding. Specifics
    can be found on my <a href="/skills/">Skills</a> page. Proof of experience
    (projects) can be found on my
    <a href="/coding-projects/">Coding Projects</a> page.
</p>
