        Hello! My name is Thomas, and this is my website that I designed from
        scratch in HTML/CSS (+ a tiny bit of JS) and Jekyll for templating (so I
        don't have to copy/paste my nav and footer 6 billion times). Here you can
        find my social media links, my skills, coding projects I'm working on and my
        rhythm game stats.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a 3rd year university student currently looking for part-time work in
        the IT industry (will be ready to transition to full-time after my
        graduation in late 2025).
    </p>
    <p>
        I specialise in web design, web development and Minecraft modding. Specifics
        can be found on my <a href="/skills/">Skills</a> page. Proof of experience
        (projects) can be found on my
        <a href="/coding-projects/">Coding Projects</a> page.
