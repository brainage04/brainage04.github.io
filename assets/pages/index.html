    Hello! My name is Thomas, and this is my website that I designed from scratch in HTML/CSS and Jekyll for templating (so I don't have to copy/paste my nav and footer 6 billion times). Here you can find my social media links, my skills, coding projects I'm working on and my rhythm game stats.
</p>
<p>
    I'm a final year university student currently looking for part-time work in the IT/CS industry (will be ready to transition to full-time after I graduate in November 2025).
</p>
<p>
    I specialise in web design, web development and Minecraft modding. Specifics can be found on the
    <a href="/skills/">Skills</a> page. Proof of experience (projects) can be found on the
    <a href="/coding-projects/">Coding Projects</a> page.
</p>
<p>
    I'm also good at video editing (YouTube videos) and especially good at graphic design (YouTube thumbnails). Proof of experience can be found on the
    <a href="/video-ediitng/">Video Editing</a> and
    <a href="/graphic-design/">Graphic Design</a> pages respectively.
</p>
